Over on the far northwestern edge of the map is Rebel's Roost, another perfect spot for passive players. There is one massive building at this POI, and you'll also find a Weapon Case at this location. Since this POI is a little far from the center, I recommend getting vehicles or rotational tools like the Grapple Blade beforehand.
