Located on the eastern corner of the map in the snowy biome, Grand Glacier is home to the new boss Montague in Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 1. This multi-storied building is the perfect spot to land at if you want to get good loot and a few early eliminations. Be careful, as the POI is guarded by AI forces, cameras, and turrets, so it's best to destroy the defenses first.
