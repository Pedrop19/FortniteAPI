Snooty Steppes is one of the new POIs located on the southwestern edge of the map in Chapter 5 Season 1. This is the location where you'll find Peter Griffin, one of the bosses carrying a Society Medallion. Since this POI will be contested by opponents, I recommend visiting this area a few times to memorize the stairs and zipline spots. There are a few vehicles parked around the edge of this POI, locate and use them to quickly get out of storm damage in case the circle starts closing.
