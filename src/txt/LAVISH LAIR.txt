Moving west from Classy Courts you'll come across Lavish Lair, a new POI located in the snow biome. You'll find the Oscar boss at this POI, and this character has several minions at their disposal. The perimeter of the building has cameras and turrets, so I'd recommend landing on the terrace to find loot, before eventually coming down. The boss is located inside the greenhouse behind the big building, so take your time to gather loot before engaging the NPC.
