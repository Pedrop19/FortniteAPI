Ritzy Riviera is a new POI located on the western banks of the grassland biome. This area looks like a dockyard, with several houses and smaller huts. There are chests scattered all around this POI, enough for an entire squad. I like landing at this POI as there are no bosses here, so you might only face a handful of opponents while dropping at this location.
