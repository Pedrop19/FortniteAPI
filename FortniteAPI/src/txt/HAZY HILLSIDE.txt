Hazy Hillside is another POI located in the snowy biome towards the southeastern side of the map. This POI is divided into a couple of blocks, and ziplines run across the houses allowing you to traverse easily. You can expect players to contest for this location as it has a Weapon Case which contains top-rarity guns with good attachments.
