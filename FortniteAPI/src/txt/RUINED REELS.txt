Ruined Reels is located near the center of the map, and it looks like a combination of the Colosseum and Risky Reels POIs from previous chapters. The buildings here are small and there's an amphitheater on the western side of the POI. Some of the houses have broken rooftops, so you can easily gain height while engaging other players at this location.
