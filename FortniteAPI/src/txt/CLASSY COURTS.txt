Over on the northern side of the map in the snowy biome is Classy Courts. A regular POI with a few tennis courts that have several chests and ample ground loot. This is a great place to land at if you are looking for a passive drop since there are no bosses at this POI. However, it is a little far from the center of the island, so find rotational tools or vehicles to move around easily.
