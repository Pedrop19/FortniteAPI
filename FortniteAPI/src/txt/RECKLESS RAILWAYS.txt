Reckless Railways is a new POI located near the center of the map in Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 1. This is where you'll come across the new Valeria boss and her team of AI combatants. The entire area is rigged with turrets and cameras, so be careful while moving around. My suggestion is to get full shields and good weapons first before engaging the boss. You'll likely face tons of opponents at this location as there's a vault located at this POI.
